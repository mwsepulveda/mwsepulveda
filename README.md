***Hello there, I'm Michael.***

* * *

My name is Michael Sepulveda, and I am currently enrolled in my last semester of undergrad, after which I hope to pursue a career in software engineering. In addition to taking classes, I am very much enjoying learning full-stack web development at the moment. In my free time I love to play video games, read books, and hangout with friends. I would love to collaborate with you some time!
